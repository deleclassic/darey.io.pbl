## 2. installing apache and updating the firewall

APACHE HTTP SERVER is the most widely used web server software. Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation, Apache is an open source software available for free. It runs on 67% of all webservers in the world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be highly customized to meet the needs of many different environments by using extensions and modules. Most WordPress hosting providers use Apache as their web server software. However, websites and other applications can run on other web server software as well. Such as Nginx and Microsoft IIS

Now, Install Apache using Ubuntuâ€™s package manager 'apt'

`sudo apt update`

run apache2 package installation

`sudo apt install apache2`

To verify that apache2 is running as a Service in my OS, i used following command

`sudo systemctl status apache2`

Please Note, if the apache2 is correctly install it will show green and running, I have just launched my first Web Server in the Clouds
